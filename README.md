# Galactica - the Interplanetary Space Travelling Agency

This webpage is a user-centric frontend development assignment, which is part of the full-stack developer course at Code Institute.

It is a homepage for an imaginary future travelling agency that sells trips into space. The website displays three products that are listed on the front page, 
described in detail on the 'journey catalogue' page, and can be purchased on the 'order' page.

The purpose of the website is to advertise the travels and persuade the customer to purchase a trip. This is done mainly by large images and catchy headlines. 
The style of the page is colorful and exciting.

The website is written in HTML 5 and CSS 3, and advanced features are created with custom javascript libraries. In order to make the website fully responsive,
the frontend javascript library Bootstrap 4 has been utilised extensively.
