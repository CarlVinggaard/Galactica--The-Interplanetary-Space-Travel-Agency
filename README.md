# Galactica - the Interplanetary Space Travelling Agency

This is a user-centric frontend development assignment, done as part of the full-stack developer course at Code Institute. The purpose of the project 
is to implement and display what I have learned about responsive design and web development so far.

The project is a website for Galactica, an imaginary future travelling agency that sells trips into space. The purpose of the website is to advertise the travels 
and persuade the customer to purchase a trip. This is done mainly by large images and catchy headlines. The style of the page is colorful and exciting. The website 
displays three products (package trips) that are listed on the front page, described in detail on the 'journey catalogue' page, and can be purchased on the 'order' 
page.

The website is written in HTML5 and CSS3, and more advanced features are created with Javascript libraries. In order to make the website fully responsive,
the frontend component library Bootstrap 4 has been used extensively. The code was written in the Gitpod IDE.

## User Experience

The target audience is people who want to travel into space. Maybe they already know where they want to go or maybe they want to explore the differnet options for space travel.

The functional and usability requirements for the site include:
- Showcase large images related to the target destinations
- Showcase practical information about the user
- Showcase contact information and social media links
- Enable the user to order a trip
- Enable seamless navigation within the site

### User Flow

User flow 1: The user wants to buy a specific package trip to space. The user can go directly into the 'Journey Catalogue' in the navigation bar and find more information about 
the trip. The user can then click 'Order' to go to the order page.

Front page -> Journey Catalogue -> Order

User flow 2: The user wants to know more about his/her options for space travel. The user can see the images on the front page, and scroll down and read about the company and 
about its technology and safety record. If the user is convinced to purchase a trip, there is a call-to-action at the bottom of the front page.

Front page -> Scroll down -> Order

### Style and Design

The website style is colorful to make it interesting, but also to make it seem more futuristic. The idea was to try to make something that did not look too minimalistic
or 'modern', but without it being too much. The navbar is a purple-red gradient which has been reused as background for certain headings. The secondary colors are orange
and blue, which can be seen in the footer or most of the buttons.

The style is heavily influenced by the 'cards', used to present single pieces of information. These have round corners and a wide box-shadow that elevate them above the
background.

### Clickable Prototype

Before writing the website, a prototype model was created to display the structure and style of the site. The prototype is made in Figma, a standard but powerful 
interface design tool. It is clickable (if you click the 'play' button in the top right corner you can interact with it). The prototype can be accessed in Figma 
in the browser with the link: https://www.figma.com/file/Ok4u5aJeHJXPGIh0Y2h9iw/Prototype?node-id=0%3A1.

## Testing

- Testing was done along the development process mainly using the devTools in Google Chrome. 
    - Responsiveness was tested using the device toolbar.
    - Troubleshooting CSS was done using the styles section of devTools.

- Tests were done on different devices:
    - desktop computer with wide monitor (Windows)
    - smartphone (OnePlus 6/Android)
    - tablet (iPad/iOS)
    - laptop (Acer/Windows)

- Tests were done in different browsers:
    - Mozilla Firefox
    - Google Chrome
    - Safari

- Important tests are:
    - Test that the content is displayed properly on small and large screens (all three pages)
    - Test that the navbar menu collapses on small screens
    - Test that the collapsed navbar works correctly

    - index.html:
        - Check that the slider/carousel changes image every 8 seconds
        - Test that the buttons on the slider link to the correct section of the journeys.html page
        - Test that the buttons in the 'journeys' section of the front page redirect correctly

    - journeys.html:
        - Test that the buttons redirect to the order.html page

    - order.html:
        - Test that the input fields are all required by submitting an incomplete form
        - Test that the e-mail field requirement works correctly, by submitting an invalid e-mail address (e.g. one that lacks '@')
        - Test that the datepicker works correctly by filling out the 'From' and 'To' fields without typing the numbers
